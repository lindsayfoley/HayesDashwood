			<h1>Guests of the Foundation</h1>
			<h3>100 flats are available for Guest accommodation</h3>
			<p>Any ex-Service or ex Merchant Navy person with an infirmity is eligible to apply to become a beneficiary of the Foundation (commonly known as a Guest) provided that he
			 or she is a British or EEA National or has indefinite permission to live in the UK after discharge from the Armed Forces. The infirmity does not have to be a result of
			  military or merchant navy service.</p>
			  <p>Spouses and dependent children may reside with the Guest as a family unit although the licence to occupy always remains in the name of the appointed Guest. All family 
			  units and single Guests must be able to look after themselves as the Foundation is fundamentally a provider of housing; it does not offer care advisory or monitoring
			   services.</p>
			  <p>Guests are appointed with a view to long-term rather than temporary occupancy. This helps towards a closer community.</p>
			  <p>Upon being appointed, the new Guest will be allocated a flat for an initial period of one year. After that, they will be offered continued rights of residence if they 
			  wish provided they have maintained their conditions of appointment. These conditions are similar to those applying to Almshouses nationally and include the right of 
			  continued Guest status for a surviving spouse or recognised partner</p>
			  <p>It may be that a Guest's housing needs will change over time and the Foundation will do its best to provide appropriately for those needs, be they for a larger or 
			  smaller property. However, the Foundation cannot guarantee to meet an assessed need for change and this could ultimately to a position of last resort where a Guest cannot 
			  remain as a beneficiary of the charity.</p>
			  <p>Guests do not pay rent but a charge is made as a contribution towards the upkeep of the property. This charge is always kept well within the limit of Housing 
			  Benefit/Local Housing Allowance and may be funded partly or wholly by the local authority for those who qualify.</p>
			  <p>Currently (2013) a one bedroomed flat, carpeted and with central heating, fitted kitchen, white goods and a small garden will be charged at about Â£106 per week. Guests 
			  are additionally responsible for their household utility charges and council tax.</p>
			  <hr>
			  <p>If you think that you might be eligible to become a Guest of the Foundation, an application form is available by post from:</p>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>The E Hayes Dashwood Foundation</li>
				<li>Estate Office</li>
				<li>26E Radbourne Road</li>
				<li>London</li>
				<li>SW12 0EF</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p>Alternatively it can be downloaded <a href="/images/application_form.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			  <p>Completion of an Application Form is essential for every applicant.  The form will ask you to provide full details of infirmity, income and housing need and to give
			   evidence of military or merchant navy service. The purpose is to enable the Foundation to make a balanced assessment on the need and merit of the applicant for charitable
			    support in housing. If you do appear to meet the criteria, you will be advised that you are a Registered Applicant. This means that your application, together with those 
				of other Registered Applicants, will be reviewed every time a vacancy arises and that you will be notified immediately if you are selected for interview. This 
				short-listing process has become necessary because of the large number of Registered Applicants we have. Interviews are normally conducted in London by a panel of 
				Governors and all appointments as Guests are made on a discretionary basis and after successful interview.</p>
			  <p>Selection interviews are only held when a property is about to become available. Whilst we keep the names of Registered Applicants for as long as they wish, we do not 
			  interview for the purpose of creating a long-term waiting list.</p>
			  <p>If you think you might be eligible, you are advised to complete an Application Form and we will let you know whether you can become a Registered Applicant.</p>
			  <p>Guest vacancies can arise and be filled within quite a short time-frame.</p>
